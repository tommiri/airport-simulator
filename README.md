# Airport simulator

A C++ program made to simulate traffic at an airport given different circumstances. This project was made as part of TAMK's Data Structures and Algorithms course and it's requirements are listed below. I achieved the best possible grade of 5 with this project.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tommiri/airport-simulator.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd airport-simulator
```

Compile the source files with g++ or another compiler of your choice

```bash
  g++ src/*.cpp -o airport-sim
```

Run the program

```bash
  ./airport-sim
```

## Usage/Examples

After choosing the version, answer the given prompts and the simulation will run, displaying a summary of events at the end. The following is an example of the summary after running the P5 simulator.
